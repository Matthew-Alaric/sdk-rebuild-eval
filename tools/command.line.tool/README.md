## Usage

The Command Line Interface (CLI) Tool can be used in the following manners.  

### Process files through Rebuild

```
commandlinetool.exe  -config=configFile [ -xmlconfig=xmlPolcyFile] 
```
**Note: The Glasswall Rebuild library must be in the same directory as the CLI tool. it is recommended to have at least 8gb of free memory to run Glasswall**

The contents of configFile and xmlConfigFile are described in the following sections.

### Other CLI command options
-v – get SDK rebuild version number.
-h – get help and command syntax information.
-a XMLOUTPUTFILE – write out all issue ids to xmloutputfile.
-b ID_NUM TXTOUTPUTFILE – write out the technical description for issue id ID_NUM to TXTOUTPUTFILE.

## Configuration File Description

This is passed to the commandlinetesttool executable using the **–config** option. 

### Configuration Format

The configuration file is a text file that enables the operation of CLI to be configured. 
The file is made up of sections and associated configuration item name\value pairs. 

For example 
```
[sectionname1] 
itemname11 = itemvalue11
itemname12 = itemvalue12 
[sectionname2] 
itemname21 = itemvalue21 
itemname22 = itemvalue22 
```

Item name must be unique within a section. Zero or more whitespace characters are allowed around the literal =. 
An example valid configuration file is shown below 

```
[GWConfig] 
processMode=0 
reportMode= 1 
fileStorageMode=0 
fileType = pdf 
inputLocation= C:\Test\bug_301 
useSubfolders=1 
 
outputLocation= Report 
createOutputFolders=1 
nonConformingDirName= NonConforming 
managedDirName= Managed 
 
quarantineNonconforming= 1 
writeOutput= 1 
 
logFileSize=0 
logFileProcessTime=1 
logProcessStatus=0
```

#### Mapping - CLI Modes To Glasswall API 

The CLI tool can be used to verify the output of API functions in the Glasswall library. This section contains information on which CLI settings trigger specific API function calls. 

The table below displays the API functions that are called under the various CLI configuration options.

Setting the FileType option to ‘*’ will enable Glasswall's file type detection capability via a call to the 
GWDetermineFileTypeFromFile API function (See the ‘Configuration Settings’ section). This will enable CLI to automatically determine the file type for each file that is about to be processed. 
Supplying the ‘–h’ option to the CLI tool will display a help menu that provides additional help information as well as instructions on how to run the tool to produce the output for the following additional API functions. 

- GWGetAllIdInfo – This retuns an XML file containing the descriptions for all possible issue IDs in the Glasswall engine. 
Command: 
```
commandlinetesttool.exe  -a output_xml.xml 
```
- GWGetIdInfo – This returns a group description for a given issue ID. 
Command:
``` 
commandlinetesttool.exe  -b 96 outputstring.txt 
```
Where 96 is the issue ID and outputstring.txt is the file in which to store the output description.

- GWFileVersion – Displays the library version number Command: 
```
commandlinetesttool.exe  -v 
```

The following API functions are called by the CLI tool when generating the Glasswall CLI process log. 
- GWFileErrorMessage – The output of this is displayed along side each processed file if a file is marked noncompliant within the process log generated everytime a set of files are processed. 
- GWFileProcessStatus – The output of this is displayed along side each processed file in the process log if the ‘logProcessStatus’ option is set to 1 (See the ‘Configuration Settings’ section).  
- GWFileProcessMessage – The output of this is displayed along side each processed file in the process log if the ‘logProcessStatus’ option is set to 1 (See the ‘Configuration Settings’ section). 
 
For more information on each API function please refer to the Glasswall SDK documentation.  

## XML Policy File Description

### Configuration Format
The format within this file is described formally in the XSD located in the glasswall sdk documentation. 
This poliy file is passed unchanged to the GWFileConfigXML function. An example of a full policy file is shown below

### Policy Details

In addition to the behaviours recorded above the following is a breakdown of specific policies that behave slightly differently:

| Type                   | Value                              | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hyperlinks             | sanitise                          | The hyperlink targets will be removed but the text will remain in the document.   This removal will be logged in analysis reports as a ‘sanitisation item’  |
| embedded_files         | sanitise                          | Embedded files within the document are passed to the Glasswall engine and are processed in accordance with there policy, files not supported by Glasswall will be removed.                                                                                       |
| embedded_images        | sanitise                           | Embedded images within the document are passed to the Glasswall engine and are processed in accordance with there policy, images not supported by Glasswall will be removed                                                                    |


## CLI Log File Format

### Files Log
Produced by CLI before the processing of the files is started.  Compiled from the specified input location, documenting the complete list of files to be processed. 
The format of each line follows the same specification. 
```
==nnnnn== Filename 
```
One file is listed on each line, where nnnnn is a zero indexed counter that increments by one for each line. 


### Application Log

Produced by CLI recording the results of processing. The file structure is made up of a header, body and footer. 

#### Header

- Line of * characters 
- Time date stamp for start of logging 
- Description of library version in use 
- Line of * characters 

**Example**
```
************************************************************* 
START LOGGING 14:24:08(15/04/2013)  
SOFTWARE VERSION PLUGIN_GLASSWALL_DLL:ANALYSE_AUDIT.MANAGE.PROTECT.01.01..BUILD(Apr 15 2013 09:43:25) 
************************************************************* 
```

#### Policy

A record of the policy settings being used by the Glasswall DLL during the run.  The information is provided in the XML format used when configuring the run. The configuration is provided by the DLL from the GWFileConfigGet function, rather than being a copy of what has been passed to CLI, so default values used will be displayed if switches are missing from the policy file. 

#### Body

Line per file, each line consisting of  
- An index number, matching the index number used in the ‘Files Log’ described above. 
- File name (preceded by a space) o Test Result (preceded by a space and a horizontal tab) o Processing Duration (preceded by two horizontal tabs) o Optional file size (preceded by two horizontal tabs) (see Configuration) 
- Optional Process Status (preceded by two horizontal tabs) and Process Status Message (preceded by two horizontal tabs) (see Configuration) 

**Example**
``` 
==00000== Found file Golden_90ms-RKSJ-H_10.pdf  	Passed  	(460 ms) 	 	(2500 MB)  	Processing Status 96  	Processing Message "Remedies Required, Sanitisation Required" 
```

#### Footer
- Line of * characters o Time date stamp for end of logging o Total duration of processing (calculated as delta between the start and end logging times) o Line of * characters 

**Example**
```
************************************************************* 
END LOGGING 15:24:08(15/04/2013)  
DURATION 01:00:00 
************************************************************* 
```
